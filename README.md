# LT-spice-based-4-bit-ripple-carry-adder-and-super-buffer
1 Implement 4 bit ripple carry adder. Optimize the adder for speed. Assume load capacitance to be 50 pF, VDD = 3.3 V. You may assume input capacitance to be 2 pF (for the input A [3:0], B [3:0] and Cin) if required in the calculation.
2 Design a superbuffer using CMOS inverters to drive a load of 100 pF, assume the input capacitance to be 2 pF.
